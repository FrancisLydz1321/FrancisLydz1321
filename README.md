- ðŸ‘‹ Hi Fellow Githubers,
- 
  Iâ€™m @FrancisLydz1321, I consider myself a beginner at programming but vigorously exerting my limits every study/coding sessions.
  I'm interested learning more on Programming languages out there and on the judgement day become proficient at it. Also might as well enhance my logical thinking and Analysis.
  Currently Learning Programming Languages such as: C, Java, python, C# (not yet), ASP.NET (not yet),  etc. Also I am eager to learn more about Web
  Development, CyberSecurity, Shells, Networking and Telecommunications, and also Study Techniques to further enhance my attentiveness :) .
  I think that's all i can share with and hoping to someone who'll see my profile are highly encourage to share some recommendations and tips in relevance of Projects, peer 
  collaborations, Bootcamps and also Books (fyi, I'm highly dependent on pdf books other than youtube videos) on Computer Programming. Thank you and keep coding.
