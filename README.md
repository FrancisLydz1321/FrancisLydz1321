- ðŸ‘‹ Hi Fellow Githubers,
- 
  Iâ€™m @FrancisLydz1321, I consider myself beginner at programming but vigorously exerting my Limits every study/coding sessions.
  I'm interested learning more on Programming languages out there and become proficient at it. Also might as well enhance my logical thinking and Analysis.
  Currently Learning Programming Languages such as: C, Java, python, C# (not yet), ASP.NET (not yet),  etc. Also I am eager to learn more about Web
  Development, CyberSecurity, Shells, Networking and Telecommunications, and also Study Techniques to further enhance my attentiveness :) .
  I think that's all i can share with hope to someone will see my profile will highly accept some recommendations and tips in relevance of Projects, peer 
  collaborations, Bootcamps and also Books (fyi, I'm highly dependent on pdf books other than youtube videos). Thank you
