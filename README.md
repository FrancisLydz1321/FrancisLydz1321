- ðŸ‘‹ Hi Fellow Githubers,
- 
  Iâ€™m @FrancisLydz1321, I consider myself as a beginner at programming. But Pushing my Limits every study/coding session
  I'm interested learning more of Programming languages out there and becoming proficient at logically thinking as well as analysis of a particular problem.
  Currently Learning Programming Languages such as: C, Java, python, C# (not yet), etc. Also I am eager to learn about Web Development, CyberSecurity, Shells,
  Networking and Telecommunications, and also Study Techniques to further enhance my attentiveness :) .
  I think that's all i can share with hope to someone will see my profile will highly accept some recommendations and tips in relevance of Projects, peer 
  collaborations, Bootcamps and also Books (fyi, I'm highly dependent on pdf books other than youtube videos). Thank you
